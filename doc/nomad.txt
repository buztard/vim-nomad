INTRODUCTION                                                *nomad*

Using Vim in a remote tmux session is very convenient, because you can detach
the running session and resume it later without leaving Vim. This is great in
situations where you login with ssh into your development machine at work or
your server to continue coding after you changed your location.
But suddenly, when you try to access a git+ssh remote (maybe through tpope's
excellent fugitive plugin) or access the |quotestar| or |quoteplus| registers,
things won't work as expected because with a new ssh connection some of your
environment variables changed and Vim doesn't know about it.
Fortunately tmux knows about these changes and this is where the |nomad|
plugin kicks in. It queries tmux for the new values and updates your
environment in Vim.


COMMANDS                                                    *nomad-commands*

:UpdateEnv [arguments]                                      *:UpdateEnv*

Updates the given environment variables in your running Vim instance. If no
arguments are given, either the variables named in
|g:nomad_default_variables| or all variables reported by
'tmux show-environment' are updated.


OPTIONS                                                     *nomad-options*

                                                    *g:nomad_default_variables*
Sets a list of environment variables that are used when no aruments are given
to |:UpdateEnv|. This variable is empty by default, so all all
environment variables are updated. Example:
>
 let g:nomad_default_variables = ['DISPLAY', 'SSH_AUTH_SOCK']
<

                                                    *g:nomad_reconnect_display*
Try to reconnect to the X11 server after running |:UpdateEnv|. Otherwise you
probably won't be able to access the |quotestar| and |quoteplus| registers
anymore. This option is enabled by default.
>
 let g:nomad_reconnect_display = 1
<

HINTS                                                       *normad-hints*

To be able to use your ssh-agent and your X11 clipboards over a ssh connection
you need to put the following options in your $HOME/.ssh/config >

 ForwardAgent yes
 ForwardX11 yes
>
